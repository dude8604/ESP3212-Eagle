# ESP3212-Eagle

This is an Eagle library for the ESP3212 module.  It's untested, but it's based on the diagram on Expressif's Taobao store.

I had to improvise for the pad sizes, so please let me know if it should be changed, or any other feedback.

If you've tested this and it works (or doesn't work) please tell me so I can post an update.

I also made a breakout board for it.
